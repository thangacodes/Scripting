# How to Run the Script:

Here is the step by steps procedure to run shell/bash scripts to activate/deactivate Python Venv.
Instead of executing it with sh, use one of the following commands:-

Script folder structure:
========================
.
├── pv_activate.sh
└── pv_deactivate.sh
1 directory, 2 files

Activate Venv:
==============
source pv_activate.sh
(OR)
. pv_activate.sh

De-activate Venv:
=================
source pv_deactivate.sh
(OR)
. pv_deactivate.sh


## Note:
Running the script with source <script name> (or) . <script name> ensures that the commands are executed in the current shell session. 
This way, when the virtual environment is activated, it updates the prompt as expected.
