## Please remember this notes as hints

# Ansible does not allow us to pass a cleartext password through the user module. Hence, we follow this method,

# Following is the command to use run an ansible playbook to Add/Update existing users password.
# We use variable in playbook that will get encrypted calling extra-vars during ansible-playbook execution.

$ ansible-playbook changepass.yml --extra-vars newpass=123

# If you wanted to run a specific task in a playbook, use the following.

$ ansible-playbook tomcat_download.yml --start-at-task 'Creating /tmp/tomcat directory'
